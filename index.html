            Aboutme
I'm a very ambitious developer looking for a role in an established IT company with the opportunity to work with the latest technologies on challenging and diverse projects.

I'm quiet confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.

If I need to define myself in one sentence that would be a  a sports fanatic, photography enthusiast, and tech-obsessed!!!
